# National Leadership Centre Alpha Prototype: Based on Elgg

This project is an Alpha phase prototype for the National Leadership Centre (NLC). This prototype is based on [Elgg](https://elgg.org/) 3.

## Prototype Objectives

The prototype is primarily focused on the following:

1. **The data structure needed to support a user directory**
    - What person data does the NLC's digital service need?
    - … in particular to support the user directory?
2. **The user interface(s) needed to support a user directory**
    - Given the data and data structure, how does one develop the interface(s) that support users finding people in a directory? 
    - Related to defined user needs and user research, as appropriate 
3. **Ease of set-up, build, etc.**
    - Both the Alpha and Beta phases are short, so any build work needs to be very efficient
    - How easy is it to get the thing in place, develop on it, etc.?
4. **Privacy, security and access controls**
    - How much control does this platform give over privacy and data security?
    - The digital service will be holding personal data, some of which may be sensitive. Does the platform support privacy and access controls over data and publishing?

## Prototype Outcomes

1. Description or outline of the data structure
2. Models of user interface(s), with testing outcomes and feedback
3. Assessment of ease and speed of build — backend; frontend
4. Assessment of privacy, access and data security

# Usage

## Repository Architecture

The repository architecture is based on [Elgg Starter Project](https://github.com/Elgg/starter-project) for Composer. View the [Elgg documentation on Composer installation](http://learn.elgg.org/en/stable/admin/composer.html) for introductory instructions on usage.

It is presumed that you will use Docker to run this project. This project uses Composer for package management.

#### Assumptions:

- Docker is installed locally already.
  - Check out the [Docker documentation for an installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/), if necessary. 
- You have Composer installed.
  - Check out the [Composer documentation for an installation guide](https://getcomposer.org/download/), if necessary.
  
### Getting started

#### Installation and configuration

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Install packages with Composer.**
  In the `public` directory of your cloned repo:
  ```
  $ composer install
  ```
3. **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit settings to suit your needs.** 
  
    This is the environment for your local Docker. Most settings should be obvious and/or self-evident. The default values are probably fine.
4. Add an entry in your local `/etc/hosts` file to access the site.

     In the `.env` file you should have set a value for `PROJECT_BASE_URL`. By default this is `nlc-elgg.docker.localhost`.
5. **If you want to start with a default pre-populated database:**
  
    See 'Import an initial MySQL DB' below.
6. **Start it up!**

    See '[Using Docker](#using-docker)' below.
7. **Navigate to the `PROJECT_BASE_URL` site**, by default [http://nlc-elgg.docker.localhost](http://nlc-elgg.docker.localhost/).

#### Using Docker

The `Makefile` and `docker.mk` included in this project provide some easy CLI tools to work with this Docker stack for Drupal.

**To start your Docker stack:**

```
$ make up
```

**To stop your Docker stack:**

```
$ make down
```

#### Make commands:

Usage:
```
$ make {command}
```
```
Commands:
    up              Start up all container from the current docker-compose.yml 
    stop            Stop all containers for the current docker-compose.yml (docker-compose stop) 
    down            Same as stop
    prune           Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes (docker-compose down)
    ps              List container for the current project (docker ps with filter by name)
    shell           Enter PHP container as default user (docker exec -ti $CID sh)
    drush [command] Execute drush command (runs with -r /var/www/html/web, you can override it via DRUPAL_ROOT=PATH)
    logs [service]  Show containers logs, use [service] to show logs of specific service
```

##### Import an initial MySQL DB into MariaDB:

If you want to import your database, in the volume directory `./mariadb-init` in the root of this repository, put your `.sql` `.sql.gz` `.sh` file(s). All SQL files will be automatically imported once MariaDB container has started. Databases will be created with the names of the `.sql` `.sql.gz` `.sh` file(s).

The default setting in `.env` is connection to a database named `drupal` so the initial import file should be named e.g. `drupal.sql` (see line 22ff).
